# PRV32_SoC
Pan's PRV32 Core, SoC Suite partly by Hong Xiaoyu

PRV32 is a 12T, FSM-based RV32I processor, with a simple SRAM-like on-chip bus. Seems slow and obsolete, but it is where the story begins.

If any problems, feel free to contact the author by 2320025806@qq.com

By the way, by the time we start to develop PRV332B, PRV332A core will be released as a public repo.

The name of the series is a neta of the 8086/80386 series.
